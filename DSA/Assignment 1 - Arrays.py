# <!-- **Q1.** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# 
# You can return the answer in any order.
# 
# **Example:**
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output0 [0,1]
# 
# **Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1][

# ðŸ’¡ **Q2.** Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

# - Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# - Return k.

# **Example :**
# Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
# Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_*,_*]

# **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)


# In[3]:


nums = [3,2,2,3]
val = 3
while val in nums:
    nums.remove(val)

# ðŸ’¡ **Q3.** Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# **Example 1:**
# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5

# Output: 2


# In[4]:


# to Solve it with O(log n) complexity we need to apply binary search algo

# ðŸ’¡ **Q4.** You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

# **Example 1:**
# Input: digits = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,4]

# **Explanation:** The array represents the integer 123.

# Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
# Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

#  **Q5.** You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

# Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

# The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

# **Example 1:**
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

# **Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
# The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    i = m - 1  # Pointer for nums1
    j = n - 1  # Pointer for nums2

    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:

            nums1[k] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
        k -= 1
    
    # Copy any remaining elements from nums2 to nums1
    while j >= 0:
        nums1[k] = nums2[j]
        j -= 1
        k -= 1

# Example usage

m = 3
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
n = 3

#  **Q8.** You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

# You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.

# Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

# **Example 1:**
